Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python. In this game, the player controls a snake, guiding it towards food while avoiding collision with its own body. Each time the snake consumes food, it grows longer and the player's score increases. The game will continue running until the player decides to exit. The highest score is saved in a text file ("data.txt") to keep track of the player's best performance.
